                    <strong>Your Event Column Account and Site.</strong><br /><br />
                    If you create an event with Event Column, you are responsible
                    for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully
                    responsible for all activities that occur under the account
                    and any other actions taken in connection with the event. You
                    must not describe or assign keywords to your event in a
                    misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended
                    to trade on the name or reputation of others, and Event Column
                    may change or remove any description or keyword that it
                    considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to
                    cause Event Column liability. You must immediately notify
                    Event Column of any unauthorized uses of your site, your
                    account or any other breaches of security. Event Column will
                    not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any

                <p>
                    <strong>Responsibility of Contributors.</strong><br /><br />
                    If you create an event, comment on an event, post material to
                    an event, post links on an event, or otherwise make (or allow
                    any third party to make) material available by means of the
                    event (any such material, \'Content\'), You are entirely
                    responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from,
                    that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content
                    in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or
                    computer software. By making Content available, you represent
                    and warrant that:
                    <br />
                    the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not
                    infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited
                    to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights,
                    of any third party;
                    <br />
                    if your employer has rights to intellectual property you
                    create, you have either
                    (i) received permission from your employer to post or make
                    available the Content, including but not limited to any
                    software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to
                    all rights in or to the Content;
                    <br />
                    you have fully complied with any third-party licenses
                    relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary
                    to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
                    <br />
                    the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms,
                    malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
                    <br />
                    the Content is not spam, is not machine- or
                    randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or
                    unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to
                    third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of
                    third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as
                    phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the
                    material (such as spoofing);
                    <br />
                    the Content is not obscene, libelous or defamatory, hateful
                    or racially or ethnically objectionable, and does not
                    violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
                    <br />
                    your event is not named in a manner that misleads your
                    readers into thinking that you are another person or company.
                    For example, your flyer or name is not the name of a person
                    other than yourself or company other than your own; and
                    <br />
                    you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code,
                    accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature,
                    uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do
                    so by Event Column or otherwise.
                    <br />
                    By submitting Content to Event Column, you grant Event Column
                    a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to
                    reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for
                    the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your
                    site. If you delete Content, Event Column will use reasonable
                    efforts to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge
                    that caching or references to the Content may not be made
                    immediately unavailable.
                    <br />
                    Without limiting any of those representations or warranties,
                    Event Column has the right (though not the obligation) to,
                    in Event Column's sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any
                    content that, in Event Column's reasonable opinion, violates
                    any Event Column policy or is in any way harmful or
                    objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use
                    of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason,
                    in Event Column's sole discretion. Event Column will have no
                    obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

                    <strong>Fees and Payment.</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Optional premium paid services such as bigger titles or
                    priority listing are available on the Website. By selecting
                    a premium service you agree to pay Event Column the monthly

                    Payments will be charged on the day you sign up for a premium

                    <strong>Responsibility of Website Visitors.</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Event Column has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the
                    material posted to the Website, and cannot therefore be
                    responsible for that material's content, use or effects. By
                    posting an event, Event Column does not represent or imply
                    that it endorses the material there posted, or that it
                    believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful.
                    You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to
                    protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses,
                    worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive
                    content. Events may contain content that is offensive,
                    indecent, or otherwise objectionable, typographical
                    mistakes, and other errors. The Website may also contain
                    material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or
                    infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary
                    rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use
                    of which is subject to additional terms and conditions,
                    stated or unstated. Event Column disclaims any responsibility
                    for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the
                    Website, or from any downloading by those visitors of content
                    there posted.

                    <br /><br />
                    We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material,
                    made available through the websites and WebPages to which
                    Event Column links, and that link to Event Column. Event
                    Column does not have any control over those non- Event
                    Column websites and WebPages, and is not responsible for
                    their contents or their use. By linking to a non- Event
                    Column website or webpage, Event Column does not represent
                    or imply that it endorses such website or webpage. You are
                    responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect
                    yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms,
                    Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
                    Event Column disclaims any responsibility for any harm
                    resulting from your use of non- Event Column websites and
                    WebPages.

                    property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights
                    of others. If you believe that material located on or linked
                    to by Event Column violates your copyright, you are encouraged
                    to notify Event Column. Event Column will respond to all
                    such notices, including as required or appropriate by
                    removing the infringing material or disabling all links to
                    the infringing material. In the case of a visitor who may
                    infringe or repeatedly infringes the copyrights or other
                    intellectual property rights of Event Column or others,
                    Event Column may, in its discretion, terminate or deny
                    access to and use of the Website. In the case of such
                    termination, Event Column will have no obligation to provide
                    a refund of any amounts previously paid to Event Column.
